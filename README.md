## Known Issues
- Some items are fully transparent, lacking any translucency or blur effects.
- Certain items have not been fully integrated with transparent/translucent features.
- Current link handling is suboptimal, preventing links from being opened directly from Voxa in your default browser (although they can be copied and pasted)
- Light mode has a few minor, easily resolvable issues.
- The "Upload File" button is non-functional, requiring users to drag and drop files above the window for uploading.
